# Waiters Tip Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the amount of tip a waiter might receive based on customer and transaction attributes such as the total bill, group size, time of day, and more. The project uses machine learning models to perform regression analysis on the classic **Seaborn Tips Dataset**.

## 📘 Overview

The notebook includes:

* Data loading and inspection
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data preprocessing (encoding categorical variables, handling data types)
* Feature selection and engineering
* Training and evaluating regression models
* Visualizations to interpret model performance

## 📊 Features in the Dataset

* **total\_bill**: Total bill amount
* **tip**: Tip given (target variable)
* **sex**: Customer gender
* **smoker**: Whether the customer is a smoker
* **day**: Day of the week
* **time**: Lunch or Dinner
* **size**: Size of the party

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

* Linear Regression
* Decision Tree Regressor
* Random Forest Regressor
* (Optionally) Support Vector Regressor

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the notebook `Waiters_Tip_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment.
2. Step through the cells to view the analysis and model results.
3. Modify or experiment with different models or parameters as needed.

## 📝 Notes

* The dataset is loaded from the `seaborn` library (`sns.load_dataset("tips")`).
* All modeling and visualization is done within the notebook.
* No external dataset download or additional scripts required.
